# Dotfiles
Here are my important config files for:
* Neovim
* Tmux
* Alacritty
* Fish

# How to use it
1. `git clone` this repo
2. Create a symlink poiting to the related file in the `.dotfiles` folder. 

### Example of usage:
```bash
# Configuring Neovim
ln -s ~/.config/nvim/ ~/.dotfiles/nvim/
# The neovim config folder is actually pointing to the dotfiles folder
```
